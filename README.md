# Final-Project
Neural Dynamics of Musical and Non-Musical Valence Processing
My final project will examine how valence influences neural processing patterns and why these differences occur, while investigating how individual differences like depression status modulate brain connectivity during musical and non-musical processing.

Neural Processing of Emotional Musical and Nonmusical Stimuli in Depression. OpenNeuro. [Dataset] doi: null https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000171/versions/00001
Participants: 39 total subjects 
o	19 individuals with depression (MDD)
o	20 never-depressed controls (ND)
•	Task conditions: 
o	Musical stimuli (positive/negative)
o	Non-musical stimuli (positive/negative)
•	Single scanning session per participant
For functional connectivity analysis, I will compute seed-based correlations from auditory regions to examine functional relationships across brain networks. This approach allows direct comparison between patients and controls to identify significant differences in connectivity patterns during emotional processing. The analysis will focus specifically on how connectivity metrics vary between groups and across different valence conditions.
For representational similarity analysis, I will construct neural pattern dissimilarity matrices for each condition and compare them with model RDMs based on stimulus features and emotional dimensions. This approach allows examination of how neural representations align with different theoretical models. I will compare representational spaces between groups to identify how depression affects neural encoding of emotional content, focusing particularly on differences in representation between musical and non-musical stimuli and how valence influences representational geometry.
As for the expected outcomes, I anticipate finding distinct neural representations for musical versus non-musical stimuli and positive versus negative valence conditions, with significant group differences in processing patterns. I expect to observe relationships between neural synchronization and subjective emotional ratings, and between depression severity and altered neural responses, particularly in emotion regulation regions. The innovation of this approach lies in the integration of functional connectivity and representational similarity analyses to investigate emotional processing across modalities, offering potential clinical applications by identifying how depression affects naturalistic stimulus processing in different contexts.
